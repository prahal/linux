Bindings for a fan connected to the PWM lines

Required properties:
- compatible	: "pwm-fan"
- pwms		: the PWM that is used to control the PWM fan
- cooling-levels      : PWM duty cycle values in a range from 0 to 255
			which correspond to thermal cooling states

Thorough description of the following bindings:
		cooling-min-state = <0>;
		cooling-max-state = <3>;
		#cooling-cells = <2>;
		thermal-zone {
			cpu_thermal: cpu-thermal {
			cooling-maps {
				map0 {
				     trip = <&cpu_alert1>;
				     cooling-device = <&fan0 0 1>;
				};
			};
		};

for PWM FAN used as cooling device can be found at:
./Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt

Example:
	pwm-fan {
		compatible = "pwm-fan";
		status = "okay";
		pwms = <&pwm 0 10000 0>;
		cooling-levels = <0 102 170 230>;
	};
